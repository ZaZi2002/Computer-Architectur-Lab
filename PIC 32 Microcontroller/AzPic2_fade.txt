/*********************************************************************
* Description:
* This project demonstrates how to program the PIC32 microcontroller so as to show the state of a switch (attached to the RB0 pin) on an LED (attached to the RB8 pin), in real time.

// We should have the address of PORTB to read from it and to detect any input; while we also need to have the address of LATB to write in it and show outputs:
la $10, PORTB// Now $10 contains the memory address of PORTB (which is 0xbf88_6120 as the datasheet asserts), so now we can read PORTB.
la $11, LATB// Now $11 contains the memory address of LATB (which is 0xbf88_6130 as the datasheet asserts), so now we can edit the LATB.
