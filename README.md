# Computer Architecture Lab
This repository contains code and simulations related to the Computer Architecture course. It covers the implementation of various fundamental computer architecture concepts, including multi-cycle MIPS processors and PIC32 microcontroller programming.

## Repository Structure
### 1. Multi-Cycle MIPS
This section contains Verilog code for a multi-cycle implementation of the MIPS processor. The design includes several key components:

- Instruction Fetch
- Instruction Decode
- Execution, Memory Access, and Write-Back
These components are combined to simulate the full functionality of a MIPS CPU using multiple clock cycles per instruction.

### 2. PIC32 Microcontroller
This section includes various PIC32 microcontroller codes, focusing on:

- Basic I/O control
- Peripheral programming
- Interrupt handling
- Timers and counters
These examples demonstrate programming techniques and hardware interaction with the PIC32 architecture.

## Requirements
Verilog simulator for MIPS.
MPLAB X IDE and XC32 Compiler for PIC32 microcontroller development.
